Sure, here‚Äôs a ready-to-copy template for your new Excel workbook with both sheets fully filled out, including the complete headers and a placeholder Result column.

üóÇ  Workbook: TestData.xlsx

1Ô∏è‚É£  Auth  (very simple)

Username	Result

45453759	
98765432	


The Result column is optional here, but I included it so you can also log PASS/FAIL of the auth step if you ever want to.

Key Points

Headers is a single-cell JSON object string‚Äîyour Java code will read it and add each header dynamically.

ExpectedOutput is a JSON array of objects, each with the 4 fields you‚Äôll validate:

productCode

accountNumber

sortCode

accountIn


Result column starts blank and will be filled with PASS or FAIL by the framework.

üì• How to Save

Create a workbook named TestData.xlsx in src/test/resources/.

Add two sheets: Auth and TestCases.

Copy the tables exactly as shown (Excel allows long JSON strings; they‚Äôll wrap automatically).



---

Once you have this Excel file ready, our next step will be to update the Java code so:

1. ExcelUtils can read:

Usernames from Auth

Test rows from TestCases



2. The framework writes back to the Result column automatically.



Would you like me to draft the updated ExcelUtils read/write helpers next?
