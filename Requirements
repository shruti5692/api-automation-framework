Hi Parmeshwar,

I want to share my understanding of the API Testing Automation Framework so we are aligned before I proceed further:

Objective: Build a reusable, data-driven framework for API testing.

Requirements:

Data-driven using Excel for test cases and expected results.

Support Basic Authentication (username/password).

Handle sensitive data through encryption/decryption.

Configurable setup for base URLs, endpoints, and file paths.

Reporting of execution status (pass/fail).


Tech Stack: Java, TestNG, RestAssured, Apache POI, AES encryption.

Flow:
Excel (test data + encrypted fields) → Framework utilities (config, crypto, data provider) → API execution via RestAssured → Response validation → Report generation.

Proposed Excel Structure:


TestName	Username	Password	Endpoint	RequestBody	ExpectedStatus	ExpectedMessage

TC01	ENC(...)	ENC(...)	/wallet-provisions	{…json body…}	200	Success


Please confirm if this matches the expectations so that I can move forward accordingly.

Thanks & Regards,
Shruti Raikar
