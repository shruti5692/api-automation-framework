Manual vs Automated Steps in the API Testing Framework

1. Manual Steps

Test Data Preparation: Creating and updating Excel sheets containing TestCaseID, ChargeID, expected values, and other input data.

Database Setup (if required): Adding or updating specific DB records to simulate certain scenarios.

Macro Preparation: Maintaining base macro files for evidence capture.


2. Automated / Integrated Steps

Dynamic Test Data Reading: Excel data is read automatically using TestNG DataProvider.

API Calls Execution: APIs are invoked programmatically based on the test data.

Database Validation: Rows are fetched from the database and compared with API responses automatically.

Temporary Macro Creation: Temp macros are generated dynamically for each test run to capture evidence.

Logging & Reporting: Test steps, pass/fail status, and evidence are logged in extent reports automatically.

JWT Token Generation: Tokens for authentication are generated programmatically without any manual intervention.

What the Framework Verifies

API Response Verification:

Status codes (e.g., 200, 400)

Response body fields and their values

Schema validation (if implemented)


Database Verification:

Ensures correct insertion or update of records after API calls

Compares API response values against DB values for accuracy


Evidence / Logging Verification:

Screenshots and other evidence captured via macros

Step-wise logging in extent reports with detailed pass/fail status and error messages


Authentication Verification:

JWT token generation and validation

Access control checks for secured endpoints

If you want, I can also add a small diagram showing the workflow (Excel → API → DB → Macro → Report) which usually impresses managers and makes the document visually strong. Do you want me to create that too?
